ECED3901 - The Git REPO
-------------------------------
This GIT repo contains a lot of raw material from me teaching ECED3901 at Dalhousie University.
Be warned it's not designed to be used directly, but is provided as a service to those who might
need something from my teaching (source files, example code, etc.).

If you are taking the course, please consider the material on BBLearn (at dal.ca/bblearn) to be the
definitive resource. Things on this git repo are often *incomplete* or possibly even wrong for your
class.
